Incidentally they are also relatively straight forward to work on using the GitHub REST API.\n\nYou will make a series of tests to prove that GitHub Gists API works correctly.\n\nYou should write tests that confirm the following things:\n\n1)Getting public Gists returns 30 Gists (you can get more via pagination, but you just need to get the first 30 and confirm that there are 30)\n2)Confirm that the user `wolfordj` has at least one public Gist\n3)Confirm that when you create a Gist the number of Gists associated to your account increases by 1\n4)Confirm that the contents of the Gist you created match the contents you sent\n5)Confirm that you are able to edit the contents of a Gist (this will require editing it and proving the edits worked)\n6)Confirm that you can add a star to a Gist\n7)Confirm that your list of Starred gists is correct\n8)Confirm you can remove a star from a Gist\n9)Confirm you can delete a Gist",
